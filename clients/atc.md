> [open] 2026-05-05 — G30 hedger not firing; position mismatch across books/envs
> Daria found G30 hasn't been hedging (causing a small loss) and noticed unexplained position divergences: HOUSE G30 = 3.03, G30EUR = -72.87; CFD_CLIENTS_NET G30EUR = -193.27. No adjustments visible to explain the gap — suspected NY-env trades not reflected in current env. Daria attempted to align currency positions with trade positions to get the hedger firing. ATC (David Manoukian) sent EOD position snapshots (client + Velocity) ~22:10 BST 2026-05-05; Daria confirmed positions are mostly in line at the risk-managed level — divergence is in non-risk-managed books. Biggest diff: DOWUSD $62k USD equivalent; G30EUR out $4.5m in trade positions (not risk managed). Daria requested equivalent snapshots post-market-close Friday/weekend to tidy non-risk-managed positions Sunday before open; full rec planned Monday morning before market open.

> [resolved] 2026-04-23 — Finalto order 022dt22vmy status unknown (session disconnect)
> Daria asked Finalto to confirm the status of XAUUSD order 022dt22vmy (4oz sell, limit 0.0). Session dropped right after the order was sent; Compass got no confirmation/fill/cancel. Malik raised with Finalto; confirmed rejected (Cancel-on-Disconnect — `39=8`, `58=Unknown ClientOrderId`) at 08:04 UTC. Daria acknowledged 2026-04-27.

> [resolved] 2026-04-30 — EUR reconciliation report action item (transient position mismatch)
> Malik flagged an action item on the reconciliation report showing a EUR position mismatch. Cameron investigated: likely a transient Compass book position caught mid-report. Malik confirmed the report cleared ~2 hours later; no outside-Compass manual trades on ATC's side. [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C04AZM0LPMH/p1777554973786509)
