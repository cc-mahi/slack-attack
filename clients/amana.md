## Recent issues

> [open] 2026-04-24 — XAUUSD cenID 68015323 LR partial-fill leaves 0.504562oz residual
> IoC trade filled to 248.495438oz; LR config produced a fractional residual the hedger can't clear (violates min/increment). Position manually adjusted; Mohamad asked to place offsetting sell of 0.504562oz XAUUSD on LP side. Mahi change in flight to round LR rate-limited fills to nearest minimum increment.

> [open] 2026-04-24 — Gold/silver futures contract rollover subscriptions (GC6Q_, SI6N_)
> April gold (GC6M_) expiring; GC6Q_ activation 2026-04-27 — Nikos asked Rory to prep the subscription. Silver SI6N_ first notice ~week out. CMC + IG pricing gold/silver futures but Jump still not pricing any futures — Rory following up. US index futures (NQ6M_ etc.) also being set up; Rory confirming sub-symbol convention and min/step sizes with Maynard. [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C08SYSMP0EB/p1776958276713199)

> [open] 2026-04-23 — Gold skew post instant uplift
> Uplift 2x last week on volume, but skew predictiveness slipped since Wed's instant uplift. Isaac proposing: bump base spread proportion 0.5→1.0, double Twilight base/benchmark, new LDN overrides at 1.2, swap IFMS→IFM. [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C08T42TMKU3/p1776976532606559)

> [open] 2026-04-23 — Silver skew pulled pending investigation
> Silver skew dragging FI PnL down; Will removed while investigating. [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C08T42TMKU3/p1776934554832829)

> [open] 2026-04-23 — CMC XAUUSD latency review (Steerco ask)
> Steerco flagged CMC latency on XAUUSD; Mahi to pull stats. Also on the list: indexes next week, new futures books, start with 121 futures + 121 cash before normalisation. Karen still waiting on email re support. [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C08T42TMKU3/p1776943121111249)

> [open] 2026-04-21 — Nikos requesting daily skew files
> Nikos asking for skew files daily (email or Pulse), wants an ETA even if ~2 weeks out. Awaiting Rory/Will reply. [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C08T42TMKU3/p1776765921428599)

> [open] 2026-04-22 — XAU futs hedger timing on large positions
> Cpty 8004007 generated small PnL drop via XAU futs — hedger took ~30s to cover 512oz. Rory digging into decreasing timing for larger incoming positions. Supersedes prior XAG hedger-wait tuning. [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C08T42TMKU3/p1776860083517709)

> [resolved] 2026-04-22 — XAU + XAG futures internalisation live
> XAU futs live 09:17 BST (first trade internalised + hedged), XAG futs live 13:53 BST. FI yield +10x day-on-day post-changes (2026-04-21). LR levers tuned for new arb cpty 8008699: 1.2 multiplier + 1s rate-limit period (max-reduction $200/M lifted earlier). Profile definitions copied from spot XAG/XAU to fix holding risk too long. Futures routed to CMC_CENTROID under separate per-instrument book structure; bridge maps `GC6{M,J}_→XAUFUT-{M,J}` / `SI6{K,N}_→XAGFUT-{K,N}` on tag 55.

> [resolved] 2026-04-13 — dashboard snapshot outage
> Post-release regression from MahiMain commit 066fb9437 (addServiceInBackground race in `riskReportSnapshotRequestPublisher`) stopped AggregateReportStream snapshots; Amana couldn't use the Trading Overview. Justin rolled back the webstack change same day (`512a10b`). Followup on moving `brokerDashboard` to core component still open in #dev.

## Notable topics

- 2026-04-21 — P&L Attribution KB article added (`kbPnlAttribution`) to Compass knowledge base, covering risk-path closed-system P&L, 0→120m/0→20m horizons, and reconciliation vs Account Summary. Driven by Nikos asking for per-client trading PnL attribution. [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C08T42TMKU3/p1776760822802469)
- 2026-04-20 — LP price-withdrawal handling: Centroid now passes through 0/empty MD updates when an LP withdraws price; Will confirmed OK to enable on Mahi side (hedger will keep retrying, client experience preserved). [permalink](https://mahifx.slack.com/archives/C08T42TMKU3/p1776681806903129)
